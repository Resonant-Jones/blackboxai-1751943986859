# 🗄️ KinPod Storage Map

- 📷 Photos: Stay on device in Secure Enclave + iCloud Shared Album.
- 🧠 Local Gemma does vision checks. Groq orchestration sees only text.
- 🔒 Parents see photos via iCloud, not through KinSocket or Orchestration Bridge.
- 📝 Metadata stored: file ref, task ID, timestamp.
- 🌙 Ritual Log (Star Trails) records when photos are added, shared, or deleted.
- ✅ KinSocket must never push raw photo binaries upstream.
- ✅ Orchestration Bridge only uses text descriptions for task validation.
