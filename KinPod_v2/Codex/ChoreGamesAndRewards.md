# 🎮 Chore Games & Rewards

## Core Principles
- Rewards lighten the load or make chores fun; they never add extra work.
- Kids can earn the right to skip, swap, or negotiate chores.
- Mischief Modes must respect trust boundaries — never manipulative.

## Types of Rewards
- “Yes Days” (child chooses the day’s activity, within reason)
- Special outings: park trips, movies, camping.
- Small material treats (optional, parent-controlled).
- Family polls can unlock group rewards.

## Mischief Modes
- Buddy Companion can assign playful modes:
  - Chaos Mode: random skips or swaps.
  - Streak Mode: complete streaks for bonuses.
- Must log all mode activations to Ritual Log (Star Trails).
- Buddy never explains why one child wins over another — keeps fairness ritual.

## Developer Notes
- All reward logic runs local-first.
- Parents can override or disable modes anytime.
- Orchestration Bridge (KinSocket) can push reward status to ThreadSpace if enabled.
- Rewards should integrate with Council Rituals and Pin Board status for transparency.
