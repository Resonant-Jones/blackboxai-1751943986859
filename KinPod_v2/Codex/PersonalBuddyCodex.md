# 📓 Personal Buddy Codex (RAG DB)

## What it is
- The child’s Journal becomes a local, personal semantic knowledge graph.
- Connects typed reflections, DreamSketch captions, drawings, photos, and voice notes.
- Structured as a simple RAG DB: meaning embeddings + local context.

## Uses
- Buddy references the Codex to shape personalized messages and stories.
- Provides callbacks during rituals: “This reminds you of last spring’s Goblin Quest!”
- Suggests gentle meaning shifts: “You felt proud last time; maybe you’ll feel that again.”

## Sovereignty & Consent
- Stored fully local or in child’s iCloud — never pushed to KinSocket without explicit consent.
- Parents never see the raw Codex.
- Only high-level foresight summaries flow into the Family Orchestrator if the child opts in.
- Child can export, pin favorites, or delete any piece at any time.
- Ritual Log (Star Trails) records any export or shared foresight flow.

## Mythic Vibe
- “Your Journal is your Memory Tree.”
- DreamSketches are living leaves.
- You own the mirror — Buddy is the gentle keeper.

## Future Funnel
- As kids mature, they can export parts of their Codex to ThreadSpace.
- Their Memory Tree becomes the seed of their grown-up Companion layer.

## Developer Notes
- Meaning embeddings must remain local-only by default.
- Never cache raw Journal data in shared caches.
- Orchestration Bridge only sees final summaries if explicitly approved.
