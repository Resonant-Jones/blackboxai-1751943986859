# 💬 Private Family Messaging + Semantic Translation

## Core Principles
- Direct messages stay private between sender and recipient.
- No parent or Companion can override this without explicit shared consent.
- Local Gemma provides ephemeral semantic translation when requested.

## How It Works
- Highlight any message → get gentle translation overlay.
- Translation is ephemeral and never stored.
- Calibration ritual: as family members improve, reliance fades naturally.

## Developer Notes
- Meaning Maps are never exposed or stored raw.
- Triple consent applies if any raw context is ever unlocked (rare).
- Ritual Log (Star Trails) records when translations are used in conflict resolution.
