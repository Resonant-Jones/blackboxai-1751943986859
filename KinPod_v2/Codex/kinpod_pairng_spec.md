//# 🗝️ KinPod Pairing Spec

## Flow
- Parent logs into ThreadSpace → detects KinPod on local device.
- Prompt: “Would you like to link your KinPod Hearth Room here?”
- User consents → KinSocket Bridge opens secure pairing.
- Parents see Family Quest, Ritual Logs, and Pin Board metadata.
- Hearth Room unlocks as contextual tab.

## Trust Boundaries
- No raw Meaning Map or Journal leaks.
- Pairing is voluntary and revocable.
- Ritual Log (Star Trails) records pairing/unpairing.

## Developer Notes
- Use secure device UUIDs + ephemeral pairing tokens.
- KinSocket only syncs final orchestration states.
- No push from KinPod unless user approves.

🗝️🌙✨
