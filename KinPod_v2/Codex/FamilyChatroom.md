# 🧵 Family Chatroom

## Purpose
- A human-only space for real family conversation.
- Not LLM-generated; Buddy does not run conversations for you.
- Used for planning, celebrating wins, negotiating swaps, and building consensus.

## Buddy's Role
- Buddy only nudges if a message needs gentle reshaping (semantic translation).
- Users can long-press any message for ephemeral Meaning Map translation.
- Buddy never reveals raw Meaning Map or explains “why” a correction is needed.

## Flow
- Family members can pin important messages.
- Final group decisions can be submitted to Guardian or Council Ritual for execution.
- All major actions logged to Ritual Log (Star Trails).

## Developer Notes
- Chatroom runs local-first; no conversation history pushed to KinSpace by default.
- Ephemeral nudges never stored.
- Parents can moderate but cannot view raw Meaning Maps.
- Orchestration Bridge may expose final decisions to ThreadSpace if consented.
