# 🗺️ Buddy’s Invisible Meaning Map Bridge

- Buddy uses each recipient’s Meaning Map to shape how messages are delivered.
- The bridge logic is local and ephemeral — never stored long-term.
- Buddy never explains “why” it nudges — no emotional debug codes, no exposed triggers.
- Any unlock of raw Meaning Map data requires full triple consent from child, parent(s), and the Companion.
- Ritual Log (Star Trails) records any unlock event.

🗝️🌙✨
