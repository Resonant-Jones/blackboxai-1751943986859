# 🫶 Family Stewardship Promise

## Core Principles
- Local Buddy is free forever for basic daily tasks and gentle companionship.
- Orchestration, vision, and extended foresight tasks are premium — priced fairly and always transparent.
- No hidden upsells, shadow upgrades, or forced subscriptions.
- Families may choose top-ups for heavier chat usage — always optional.
- Meaning Maps remain sealed by default; triple consent is required for any raw unlock.
- Families own their data and flow — no exploitation, no forced context scraping.

## Developer Notes
- Ensure all premium features are gated clearly; do not auto-enroll families in paid tiers.
- Ritual Logs (Star Trails) must record all major premium usage decisions.
- No hidden data streams for upsell targeting.
- Ad model must remain sovereign and opt-in only, as defined in SovereignAds.md.
