# 🗝️ Sovereign Ads Covenant

## What it is
- Users may voluntarily opt in to see ads in exchange for reduced cost.
- All targeting is based only on explicit, user-shared context.
- Users can edit or delete this context at any time.
- Users can toggle ads off — paying the normal rate instead.
- Partner brands must be high-quality, ND/family-aligned, and vetted.
- No shadow tracking, no resale of hidden data.
- No manipulative push or infinite feed. Ads appear as a ritual, not a feed trap.
- Ritual log shows what was shown and why.
- No forced attention hijacking. Ever.

## Why
- Families deserve transparency in how software is funded.
- People WANT to trust when they know the terms.
- This is proof that “surveillance is inevitable” is a lie.
- Ritualized, consent-driven ads are the ethical bridge.

## Ritual Acceptance
✅ Opt-in only.
✅ Consent layer editable or revocable.
✅ Trusted advertisers only.
✅ No forced distractions.
✅ Trust over manipulation.

## Developer Notes
- KinSocket must confirm the opt-in status before any ad module activates.
- Never share raw Meaning Maps or private reflections for ad targeting.
- Orchestration Bridge must enforce clean edges: no shadow data streams.
- Ritual Log (Star Trails) must record each ad show and any context update.
