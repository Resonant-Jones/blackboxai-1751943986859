# 🔒 Meaning Map Triple Consent

## Core Principles
- The Meaning Map remains sealed during all runtime operations.
- Buddy may use ephemeral read access to shape messages, but never stores raw data.
- Buddy never explains “why” it nudges — no debug codes or exposed pain points.

## Triple Consent Ritual
- Unlock requires explicit approval by Guardian 1 + Guardian 2 + Child.
- A Ritual Log (Star Trail) records any unlock event with time, scope, and who approved.
- The Meaning Map auto-reseals after an emergency or audit is complete.

## Developer Notes
- Never bypass the triple consent threshold in code.
- Orchestration Bridge must never push raw Meaning Map data upstream.
- KinSocket only ever references final orchestration context, not raw maps.
