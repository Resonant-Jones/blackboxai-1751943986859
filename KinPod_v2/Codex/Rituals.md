# 🕯️ KinPod Rituals

## Daily Ritual
1. Pick your Buddy & Game Mode (optional).
2. Reveal one small quest or task.
3. Commit and do it immediately — no overwhelm.
4. Log your completion in Lorekeeper (Star Trail entry).
5. Celebrate with Buddy. Mischief Mode can unlock gentle rewards.

## Weekly Ritual
- Feed the Goblin: add 3+ new quests to your Family Pod.
- Reflect in the Hearth Room or Journal: what did you love doing? What felt heavy?
- Tweak your Buddy’s vibe: adjust tone, style, or Mischief Level.
- Run a Council Ritual if needed: reshuffle tasks, vote on chores, or unlock new privileges.
