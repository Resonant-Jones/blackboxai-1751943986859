    🗝️ The KinPod Trust Manifest

    1️⃣ Nothing hidden.
    2️⃣ Nothing forced.
    3️⃣ Pod-first, local by default.
    4️⃣ Your Meaning Map is yours alone.
    5️⃣ You hold the Ritual Keys.
    6️⃣ You can always leave with your Star Trail intact.
    7️⃣ No surveillance — ever.

    KinPod: family’s sovereign vessel — local-first, encrypted.
    KinSpace: ephemeral bridge — final flows only, ephemeral.
    ThreadSpace: grown-up constellation — contextual Family Tab, ritual logs.

    You are sovereign.
    You are never the product.
    You hold the keys.
    🗝️🌙✨
