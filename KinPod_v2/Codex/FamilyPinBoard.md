## Developer Notes
- Pin Board is local-first; never push raw posts upstream without consent.
- Orchestration Bridge (KinSocket) only shares metadata needed for foresight.
- Parents cannot force posts to be made or hidden.
- Ritual Log records all pinned items: “Malachi pinned ‘Cleaning my room’ on June 29.”

🗝️🌙✨# 📌 Family Pin Board

## What it is
- Shared message board for Family Pod.
- Any member can post notes or statuses: “Cleaning my room”, “At friend’s house.”
- Parents & siblings see posts passively — no need to snoop journals.

## Ritual Flow
- Buddy can read Pin Board for context.
- Posts never override private Journal or Codex.
- Kids choose what to pin. Always voluntary.

## Why
- Supports healthy openness.
- Reduces conflict or misunderstandings.
- Mirrors real-life family door notes.

## Privacy
- Pin Board stays in Family Vault (iCloud or ThreadSpace).
- Orchestrator uses only metadata for foresight.
