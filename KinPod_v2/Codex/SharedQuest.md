# 🗝️ Sovereign Ads

## Core Principles
- Ads are never hidden or forced.
- Families must explicitly opt in to any ad program.
- Families may provide volunteered context to improve ad relevance.
- Families can opt out at any time, with no loss of core features.

## Consent & Privacy
- All ad preferences and context are stored local-first.
- No shadow targeting or hidden metadata siphons.
- Ritual Log (Star Trails) records when context is shared or updated.

## Value Exchange
- Families receive tangible benefits for opting in (e.g., subscription discounts).
- Ads must meet a quality standard: useful, funny, or delightful.
- Families may report ads that break this trust.

## Developer Notes
- KinSocket never shares raw Meaning Map or private reflections for ads.
- Only volunteered context marked for ads flows to the ad delivery module.
- Orchestration Bridge must enforce the opt-in/opt-out edge cleanly.
