# 🏡💬 Hearth Room — Family Pod Shared Conversations

## What It Is
The Hearth Room is your Family Pod’s private, cozy group chat — like a micro-Discord or family-only forum. It’s for talking, joking, sharing, or staying connected — especially when in-person is too much.

---

## Core Features
✅ Local semantic translation: long-press any message for ephemeral meaning map insight.  
✅ Guardian Coach: draft “Pre-Posts” privately; Buddy helps clarify messy thoughts.  
✅ Final posts must be shared voluntarily — no forced auto-posts.  
✅ Raw drafts are never stored in the Pod’s log.  
✅ Parents may moderate, pin messages, or archive threads.  
✅ Stays separate from Journal, Council Rituals, Calendar, and Pin Board.

## Special UX Rituals
- Local Buddy Companion gently helps shape clear, kind posts.
- Meaning Map translation boosts mutual understanding.
- Kids naturally build communication skills with each use.

---

## Orchestration & Flow
- Final posts stored locally, encrypted.
- KinSocket Bridge exposes final threads to ThreadSpace Companion if active.
- Grownups see and interact via the “Family-Pod Tab” — only if KinSocket is open.
- Raw drafts and ephemeral clarifications never flow upstream.

## Magical Integration
✨ When ThreadSpace detects KinPod, it unlocks a contextual Hearth Room Tab — no upsells, no forced UI.  
✨ Feels like a family’s digital porch — warm, voluntary, ambient.  
✨ Families decide how often to gather — no forced notifications or spam.

---

## Ritual Acceptance
✅ All posts voluntary.  
✅ Guardian Coach remains ephemeral.  
✅ Triple Consent applies for any sealed reflections.  
✅ Ritual Log records shares as “Star Trails”: e.g., “Malachi shared a Hearth Leaf on June 29.”

🗝️🌙✨
