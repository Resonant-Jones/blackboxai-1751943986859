# 🧭 KinPod — Privacy-First Family Companion
# KinPod
## 🗝️ Name Substitution Ritual

- All code, UI text, and system references should default to **“KinPod”** as the Family Pod’s name.
- “Buddy Beacon” is deprecated as a container name — it may appear as a Companion’s default guardian personality but is not the Pod name.
- Developers must search-and-replace any “Buddy Beacon” labels in:
  - Local DB schema
  - UI strings
  - System logs
  - Orchestration layer docs

✅ Use “KinPod” for the container.
✅ Use “Buddy” for the default guardian personality only.
✅ Personality name can be changed during or after Imprint Zero.
✅ Imprint Zero remains optional — fallback is default “Buddy” until personalized.
