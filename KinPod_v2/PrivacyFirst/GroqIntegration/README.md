# ☁️ Groq Orchestration

- Handles multi-user scheduling & conflict resolution.
- Merges local text logs — never stores raw photos or Meaning Maps.
- Switches to cloud chat for longer or deeper conversation if local device is stressed.
- Parents can approve or deny extended chat topics.
- Ritual Log (Star Trails) records when cloud orchestration is triggered.
- Always fallback to local Gemma if cloud is disabled.
