# 🗝️ KinPod Pairing Spec

## Purpose
Defines how KinPod pairs with ThreadSpace. Families always choose to link — never forced.

## Flow
- ThreadSpace detects KinPod on local device.
- Prompt: “Do you want to unlock the Family Hearth Room Tab?”
- Parents and kids must consent to open KinSocket Bridge.
- Only final orchestration states, Ritual Logs (Star Trails), and Pin Board metadata flow upstream.
- No raw Journal or Meaning Map data ever leaves KinPod without triple consent.

## Security & Revocation
- Secure device UUIDs + ephemeral pairing tokens.
- Pairing is fully voluntary and can be revoked any time.
- Ritual Log records pairing, unpairing, and scope changes.

## Developer Notes
- KinSocket Bridge only exposes final state data.
- No ephemeral Buddy drafts or raw Codex entries.
- Parents see shared context — not sealed layers.
