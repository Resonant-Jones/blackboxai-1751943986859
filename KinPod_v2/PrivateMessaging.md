## What it is:
- Family members can send private messages to each other.
- Local Gemma 3n provides meaning maps:
   - Original message
   - Gentle semantic translation per senderâ€™s Imprint Zero.

## Media:
- Text, voice, photos.
- Vision checks stay local.

## Privacy:

- Optional: Submit final agreements to Guardian.

## Purpose:
- Collapse ambiguity, decode tone, promote real communion.

## Ritual Boundaries:
- Meaning Maps used only for ephemeral translation.
- No raw Meaning Map storage or upstream push.
- Triple consent required for any deeper unlock.
- Ritual Log (Star Trails) records when translation is used for conflict resolution.
